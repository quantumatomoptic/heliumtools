# Trap properties calculations

This module of the [heliumtools](../README.md) package analyze cold-atom traps combining (far off-resonant) laser beams and (circular) magnetic coils. It was first developped by [Alexandre Dareau](https://github.com/adareau) in the [odt-calc package](https://github.com/adareau/odt-calc) but was forked and implemented into the heliumtools package in 2022.
