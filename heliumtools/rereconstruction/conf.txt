====================================================
================= SHORT REMINDER ===================
====================================================
The configuration file must have the following lines :
* Line 1: The sequence folder we want to re-reconstruct : for example `/mnt/manip_E/2022/11/23/003`,
* Line 2: The folder in which we want to create the .atoms files. This folder should not exists.
* Line 3: The reconstruction program number we want to use. See the available reconstruction program below.
* Line 4: The maximum deviation allowed for the offset from the offset map.
* Line 5: The minimum deviation allowed for the reference offset.


The available reconstructions are the following
* Reconstruction 1 : [Ziyad style](#reconstruction1-program)
* Reconstruction 2 : Ziyad Style with Offset Map (useless reconstruction, here for historical reasons).
* Reconstruction 3 : Recovering All Potential Atoms taking into account offset maps.
* Reconstruction 4 : Recovering All Potential Atoms Without Any Offset Filter
* Reconstruction 5 : Recovering Only Isolated Atoms for very dilute clouds
* Reconstruction 6 : Recovering All Atoms taking into account offset maps (we select atoms from the potential atoms list)
